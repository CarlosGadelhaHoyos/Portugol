# Algorithm Exercises
---
**Hello World!** This repository will be used to show the exercises proposed in the discipline of algorithms of the Video Course, which is available on the [youtube platform][curso em video youtube channel], and on its [official website][curso em video official site]. The document presented in the course had 100 examples of problems to solve using an algorithm.
So I'll do it! 100 proposed exercises, so there will be 100 exercises done.

The exercises in this repository were done with the Portugol Studio software. It is a text editor for Algorithms and uses Brazilian Portuguese words in its syntax. I used to use Visualg as my text editor, but after I find Portugol, I prefered it's visuals, simplicity and others things instead of Visualg.
