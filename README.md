Algorithm Exercises

Hello World, this repository is going to be used to show the exercises proposed in the algorithm course of Curso em Video. The document shown in the course had 100 examples of problems to solve using algorithm.
So I'm going to do it! 100 exercices proposed, then will be 100 exercices did.

The exercises in this repository were done with the Portugol Studio software. It is a text editor for Algorithms and uses Brazilian Portuguese words in its syntax. I used to use Visualg as my text editor, but after I find Portugol, I prefered it's visuals, simplicity and others things instead of Visualg.
